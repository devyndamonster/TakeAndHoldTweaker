# TakeAndHoldTweaker
An H3VR plugin for modifying Take &amp; Hold! Has support for custom characters, as well as global tweaks to spice things up.

## Installation
0. **Make sure you uninstalled older versions of TNHTweaker before continuing**
1. Install the [Deli Mod Loader](https://github.com/Deli-Counter/Deli)
    - Deli requires the x64 version of BepInEx, you can find installation instructions for that [here](https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html?tabs=tabid-win)
    - By default the games root folder path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3VR`
2. Download and install [Magazine Patcher](https://github.com/devyndamonster/MagazinePatcher)
3. Download the `Devyndamonster-TakeAndHoldTweaker.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/devyndamonster/TakeAndHoldTweaker/releases)
4. Extract that zip file into your `BepInEx/plugins` folder
5. Run H3VR once, and enter the Take &amp; Hold menu scene
    - This may take a while, as it will have to generate a compatible magazines cache
    - This will also generate a config file inside your `BepInEx/configs` folder
6. Place any character files into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder

## Current Custom Characters

***NOTE:*** Custom characters have moved! You can find them on [Thunderstore!](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/?q=&ordering=last-updated&included_categories=55)
